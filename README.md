# IMMD
Integrated Modular Motor Drive Design With GaN Power FETs

The aim of this project is to design and implement a PCB for an IMMD system.
A modular PCB will be developed and there will be measurements, communication, pwm and gate drive circuits.

First, the things that should be considered while designing schematic and layout are being looking for.
